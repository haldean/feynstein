\subsection{Source Code Management}

In order to manage our team's source code, we used Git, which is a
distributed version control system. It allowed all of us to
simultaneously work on Feynstein and then easily merge our changes
together. Git also allowed us to easily track peoples' contributions
to the code base, as it allows a user to see exactly who wrote each
line of code in a repository.
